# Analyzing Excel Spreadsheet Using Python

This repository consists of two different modules. Here we are required to read in CSV files, process the data to get the information we need and then print the results out to terminal and a text file.

## Financial Analysis
The first represents a basic financial analysis of a company. We read in a CSV file where the first attribute is the month and the second attribute is the profit/loss for that month. Now we are required to find the total number of months this analysis covers, the average change and the largest increase and the greatest decrease and their respective months.

Below you will find the results being printed to the terminal:

## Election Results
This module looks at a CSV that contains voter ID, County in which the votes were cast and names of the candidates. Here we print out the total number of votes cast, extract unique candidate names, count the number of times each candidate showed up in the list to get the number of votes and percentage of votes they received, and then print out the winner.
